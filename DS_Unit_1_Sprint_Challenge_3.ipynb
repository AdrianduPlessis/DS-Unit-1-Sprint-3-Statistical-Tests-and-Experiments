        "Explore the data: you can use whatever approach (tables, utility functions, visualizations) to get an impression of the distributions and relationships of the variables. In general, your goal is to understand how the features are different when grouped by the two class labels (`+` and `-`).\n",
        "\n",
        "For the 6 continuous features, how are they different when split between the two class labels? Choose two features to run t-tests (again split by class label) - specifically, select one feature that is *extremely* different between the classes, and another feature that is notably less different (though perhaps still \"statistically significantly\" different). You may have to explore more than two features to do this.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the categorical features, explore by creating \"cross tabs\" (aka [contingency tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table)) between them and the class label, and apply the Chi-squared test to them. [pandas.crosstab](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.crosstab.html) can create contingency tables, and [scipy.stats.chi2_contingency](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html) can calculate the Chi-squared statistic for them.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 9 categorical features - as with the t-test, try to find one where the Chi-squared test returns an extreme result (rejecting the null that the data are independent), and one where it is less extreme.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE** - \"less extreme\" just means smaller test statistic/larger p-value. Even the least extreme differences may be strongly statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your *main* goal is the hypothesis tests, so don't spend too much time on the exploration/visualization piece. That is just a means to an end - use simple visualizations, such as boxplots or a scatter matrix (both built in to pandas), to get a feel for the overall distribution of the variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is challenging, so manage your time and aim for a baseline of at least running two t-tests and two Chi-squared tests before polishing. And don't forget to answer the questions in part 3, even if your results in this part aren't what you want them to be."
